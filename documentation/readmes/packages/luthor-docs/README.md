# Luthor Package Documentation Redirect

This folder remains as a compatibility entrypoint for older links.

Canonical `@lyfie/luthor` docs now live here:

- Developer architecture: [../../../developer/luthor/architecture.md](../../../developer/luthor/architecture.md)
- Developer source map: [../../../developer/luthor/source-file-reference.md](../../../developer/luthor/source-file-reference.md)
- Maintainer notes: [../../../developer/luthor/maintainer-notes.md](../../../developer/luthor/maintainer-notes.md)
- User getting started: [../../../user/luthor/getting-started.md](../../../user/luthor/getting-started.md)
- User presets/configuration: [../../../user/luthor/presets-and-configuration.md](../../../user/luthor/presets-and-configuration.md)
- Extensive editor guide: [../../../user/luthor/extensive-editor.md](../../../user/luthor/extensive-editor.md)

Legacy pages in this folder are intentionally kept and linked to canonical sources to avoid broken navigation.
