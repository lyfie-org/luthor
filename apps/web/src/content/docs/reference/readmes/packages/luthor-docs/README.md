# [Luthor](/demo/) Package Documentation Redirect

This folder remains as a compatibility entrypoint for older links.

Canonical `@lyfie/luthor` docs now live here:

- Developer architecture: [../../../developer/luthor/architecture.md](/docs/reference/developer/luthor/architecture/)
- Developer source map: [../../../developer/luthor/source-file-reference.md](/docs/reference/developer/luthor/source-file-reference/)
- Maintainer notes: [../../../developer/luthor/maintainer-notes.md](/docs/reference/developer/luthor/maintainer-notes/)
- User getting started: [../../../user/luthor/getting-started.md](/docs/reference/user/luthor/getting-started/)
- User presets/configuration: [../../../user/luthor/presets-and-configuration.md](/docs/reference/user/luthor/presets-and-configuration/)
- Extensive editor guide: [../../../user/luthor/extensive-editor.md](/docs/reference/user/luthor/extensive-editor/)

Legacy pages in this folder are intentionally kept and linked to canonical sources to avoid broken navigation.
